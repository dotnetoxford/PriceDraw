# Price Draw

### ***Note: This is work in progress, and isn't yet ready for use!***

This is a tool written for the .NET Oxford meetups when we do price draws. Whilst primarily written for .NET Oxford, it can be used by any meetup. Eventually, it'll have Meetup.com API integration to retrieve the list of event attendees.

At the moment, it reads the `TestData\TestAttendeeData.txt` file for a list of attendees. You can export this list directly from Meetup.com until the Meetup.com API has been integrated (see #3).
