If you'd like to use these sound effects, then remove the `_disabled` bit from the filename(s). You can also swap these sound effects out with other wav files if you prefer different sounds.

I've disabled these by default, as I noticed sometimes on my machine, it would slow things down a bit, and stutter. So if you do use sound effects, make sure you test it and make sure it's not stuttering on the machine you'll be doing the prize draw on.
